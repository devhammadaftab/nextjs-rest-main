Create an API endpoint to get all of the films that an Actor has played in using:

https://swapi.dev/api/people

This endpoint should accept a query string parameter called `id` and return a list of films that the actor has played in.

Have a dropdown of actors then you can select an actor to show their films and then film data for that film

two dropdown actor and film dropdown and actor should come from the api and implement some cards using bootstrap,
